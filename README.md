COS20031-Computing Technology Design Project - Beauty Salon Application

Project Overview
This repository contains the final term submission for Group 2 of the COS20031-Computing Technology Design Project course. Our project is structured into two main components: the frontend and the backend, which currently operate independently and have not yet been integrated.

Frontend
The frontend of our application consists of the following HTML pages:

home.html: This is the main entry point of our application. Here, users are greeted with the initial interface of our Beauty Salon application.
test.html: This page is designed for testing the navigation feature, which helps users find routes from their current location to the service provider's facilities.
Backend and Database
The backend and database code are organized into separate files, each associated with its own test interface:

Developers need to access individual test files to execute and verify the backend functionalities.
Development and Contributions
Developers are encouraged to explore both frontend and backend parts separately as integration is pending. To contribute to the project, please refer to the specific test files mentioned in the backend section.

Project Team
This project was developed as part of the coursework for COS20031 by Group 2, focused on delivering a robust technological solution for beauty salons.
